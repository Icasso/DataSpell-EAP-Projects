Know that sounds weird but average former smoker had to attempt quitting like 7-ish times or something close to that. I quit 10 years ago and it took about 8 tries. This [study]( says 30 times on average (just read the conclusions paragraph). Maybe get a bat that looks like a cigarette and ditch the bong. Your brain tricks easier than you think. Try to smoke fewer and fewer cigarettes every time you come back to them. Its easy to give-up when you quit for a couple weeks and slip. If it happens, at least make sure you don't come back as heavy a smoker as you were before. So remember its going to take some tries so you don't have to hate-smoke yourself to death because you gave up after a good 9 day run. You want your cigarettes smoked chart to look bearish; lower highs and lower lows. But it doesn't have to crash overnight for you to be successful.

Get some good food you haven't had in awhile, that shit will taste better, no bullshit. Plus you'll have the $ for it because you won't be spending it on smokes. Then one time when you quit, you'll cave and smoke one and it'll taste like shit. You'll wonder why the fuck you need this in your life. You won't finish the cigarette because it gross.
